jsrotate
========

web page rotation in all three directions for webkit

view the demo and bookmarklet at http://zhangerr.github.com/jsrotate/

for some reason the scripts will only load in firefox if they are served over http (https doesn't work)
however, that means the bookmarklet will not work on https pages in chrome because it blocks insecure content on https connections
firefox seems to load http on https however

i don't even want to test MSIE support

opera doesn't support rotateX and rotateY apparently
